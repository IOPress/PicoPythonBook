# PicoPythonBook

This repo contains the programs 
in the book Programming the Raspberry Pi Pico/W in MicroPython, Third Edition

Each program is stored in a folder corresponding to the chapter and then
in a subfolder with the name of the program.

You can either download a ZIP of the code and extract the programs you want to 
try out or you can clone the repo.

Notice that some programs in the book are small modifications of earlier programs
In some cases the small modifications are included as comments.
Remove the hashes to convert the program in the modified program.

Only raise an issue if there is a bug in a program.
For general enquiries about the book including errata
please email the book's editor mike.james@i-programmer.info.
